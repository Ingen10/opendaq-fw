Serial protocol
===============

For reasons of compatibility with Arduino_ platform, USB handler uses a VCP
(Virtual COM Port) configuration. Thus, when the device is connected to a
computer, a new COM port is created, and it can be accessed as any other serial
port. In order to communicate with openDAQ, the following settings must be
configured in the terminal program that you are using:

- Rate: 115200 baud
- Data Bits: 8
- Parity: None
- Stop Bits: 1
- Flow Control: None

Following is a description of openDAQâ€™s low level protocol. Device communicates
with host computer by means of a binary serial protocol. There are two kinds of
commands used by openDAQ:

- `Regular command format`_, used for most of the commands.
- `Stream data format`_, used by the STREAM_DATA_ packet to transmit large
  chunks of data when the device is running in Stream mode.

Regular command format
----------------------
Normal openDAQ commands (aka Regular Commands) use a minimum of 4 bytes to
transmit a message to the device. Maximum allowed length for these packets is
64 bytes.

First two bytes consist on a 16 bit checksum or CRC. This checksum is
calculated doing the sum of all other bytes in the packet into a 16 bit
integer. Then, the result is complemented.

Be aware that some commands transmit 16 bit integers, and they do it in
big-endian_ format (higher bytes first), while Arduino stores variables in its
memory in **little-endian** format (lower bytes first).

======= ======================= =========== ===========
Byte    Description             Value       Notes
------- ----------------------- ----------- -----------
0       CRC16H
1       CRC16L                              Sum of all bytes 2-63 complemented with ``0xFFFF``
2       Command number          1-255
3       Number of data bytes    0-60        Total amount of data bytes (4-63)
4:63    Data                                16 bit words represented in **big-endian** format
======= ======================= =========== ===========

Device will react to all these commands with a response with the same command
number and different fields of data depending on the command. (Command-Response
mode)

Stream data format
------------------
Stream Data packets differ from normal commands because the device sends them
without being asked to do it, and no further response is expected.

When openDAQ is performing one or more simultaneous experiments, recorded data
should be transmitted as fast as possible in order not to saturate limited
internal memory buffers. The device can't wait for the computer to ask for
data, but instead it will send that data in packets as fast as possible.  In
order to keep synchronization between openDAQ and the host computer, this
packets use a method called `escaping characters`. An escape character is a
byte of data which invokes an alternative interpretation on subsequent
characters in a sequence. It is a common technique, used in many other serial
protocols, like PPP (the protocol used to control phone modems). 

In this case, we are using hexadecimal number ``0x7E`` (decimal 126) to indicate
the start of a new packet. To ensure that no other byte in the packet has the
same value, we use another escape character, ``0x7D`` (decimal 125). When this
character appears, it indicates that following byte must be modified in order
to be processed adequately. In this case, the character following a ``0x7D`` must
be exor'ed with ``0x20``. For example, ``0x7E`` data byte will be transmitted in
two bytes: ``0x7D 0x5E``.

6       P-input             1-8             Positive/SE analog input (default 5)

9-57    Data                                Data points (16 bit) stored for that DataChannel
======= =================== ==============  ====================================================

Resume: All bytes with value ``0x7E`` or ``0x7D`` must be escaped (``byte ^ 0x20``)
and preceded by ``0x7D``, except init byte.
